Visualizing Data with Leaflet

Using an earthquake data set from USGS ([USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)), the JSON will be pulled from the data in order to create the map. A map is created using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude. The data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color. Popups provide the name of the place and the magnitude. A legend will provide context for your map data.
